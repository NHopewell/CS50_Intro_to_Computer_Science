## Harvard CS50 - Introduction to comp sci  

I took this course mainly for low-level exposure to C and to implement data structures in C. As well for its world famous quality of material. It progresses to high level Python implementations, SQL, and web programming. The course wraps up with a discussion about life after CS50 which introduces the student to a breadth of new topics to explore which build ones mastery of programming and development to new heights. CS50 has 2 other stand alone courses for web development with Python and JS as well as mobil app development with React Native.
