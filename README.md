## Harvard CS50 - Introduction to comp sci  

Harvards world famous CS50 course. Considered by many to be the single best computer science course ever taught around the world.  

I took this course mainly for low-level exposure to C and to implement data structures and searching/sorting algorithms in C. As well for its notoriously high quality of material and incredible community. It progresses to high level Python implementations, SQL, and web programming. This course is taken around the world by everyone from newbies to PhD computer scientists and developers alike.
