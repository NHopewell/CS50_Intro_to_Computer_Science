## Harvard CS50 - Introduction to comp sci  

Harvards world famous CS50 course. Considered by many to be the single best computer science course ever taught around the world. This course is taken by everyone from newbies to PhD computer scientists and senior developers alike to challenge themselves and keep their core cs knowledge sharp. 

I personally took this course mainly for more low-level exposure to C by implementing data structures and basic to intermediate algorithms in C. As well for its notoriously high quality of material and incredible community. The course progresses to higher level abstractions in Python. It also covers SQL and its applications.
