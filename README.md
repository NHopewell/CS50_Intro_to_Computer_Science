## Harvard CS50 - Introduction to comp sci  

I took this course mainly for low-level exposure to C and to implement data structures in C. As well for its world famous quality of material. It progresses to high level Python implementations, SQL, and web programming. The course wraps up with a discussion about life after cs50 which introduces the student to a breadth of new topics which can take their matery of programming and development to the next level.
