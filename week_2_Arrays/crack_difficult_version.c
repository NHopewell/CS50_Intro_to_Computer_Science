/* crack.c tries to crack a hased password. 

Specifications
1. Your program should accept one and only one 
    command-line argument: a hashed password.
2. If your program is executed without any command-line
   arguments or with more than one command-line argument, 
   your program should print an error (of your choice) and 
   exit immediately, with main returning 1 (thereby signifying
   an error).
3. Otherwise, your program must proceed to crack the given 
   password, ideally as quickly as possible, ultimately printing 
   the password in the clear followed by \n, nothing more, nothing 
   less, with main returning 0.
4. Assume that each password has been hashed with Câ€™s DES-based 
   (not MD5-based) crypt function.
5. Assume that each password is no longer than five (5)
   characters. Gasp!
6. Assume that each password is composed entirely of alphabetical 
   characters (uppercase and/or lowercase).

Example: 
$ ./crack 50cI2vYkF0YU2
